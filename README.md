# Machine Learning Practical

This repository contains the course materials for the University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk) course [Machine Learning Practical](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/).

This assignment-based course focuses on the implementation and evaluation of machine learning systems. Students will gain hands-on experience in designing, implementing, training, and evaluating machine learning systems through practical exercises and assignments.

## Repository Structure

The code in this repository is organized as follows:

* **`mlp` package**: A [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)-based neural network library designed specifically for this course. Students will implement parts of this package and extend it during labs and assignments.
* **`notebooks` directory**: A collection of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks containing explanatory material and hands-on coding exercises for the course labs.


## Coursework 1
This branch contains the python code and latex files of the first coursework. The code follows the same structure as the labs, in particular the mlp package, and a specific notebook is provided to help you run experiments.
 * Detailed instructions are given in MLP2025_26_CW1_Spec.pdf (see Learn, Assignment Submission, Coursework 1).
 * The [report directory](https://github.com/cortu01/mlpractical/tree/mlp2025-26/coursework1/report) contains the latex files that you will use to create your report.
